Fastbreak is an rule based O(n) algorithm for detecting translocations and other genetic structural variants from aligned mate pair sequence data in SAM/BAM format. It is primarily of use as a coarse screen or prefilter for structural variation in studies where the amount of data prevents other methods from finishing in a reasonable amount of time. It is implemented here in python (2.5-2.7) but is simple enough to quickly port to other languages including distributed database query languages.
